# mediawiki-mailer
A python 3 program, that makes it possible to use mediawiki pages as mailing lists.
Write a mail to articlename@yourserver and that mail is sent to all users who are linked in that article.

Note that this code base is unmaintained and the code quality is far from production-grade.

## Setup

Configure your mail server to pipe the incoming mails into the `mail_handler` executable.
