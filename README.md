# mediawiki-mailer
A python 3 program, that makes it possible to use mediawiki pages as mailing lists. Write a mail to articlename@yourserver and that mail is sent to all users who are linked in that article.

We are currently working on a replacement for this, written in solid Rust, with a web GUI and shiny sprinkles. Wait for it...
